The failure of the Board to enforce any provision of the Declaration, Bylaws, or any rule or regulation shall not be deemed a waiver of the right of the Board to do so thereafter. 

(a) Notice. Prior to imposition of any sanction hereunder, the Board or its delegate shall serve the alleged violator with written notice describing: (i) the nature of the alleged violation; (i) the proposed sanction to be imposed; (i) a period of not less than ten (10) days within which the alleged violator may present a written request to the Covenants Committee, if any, or Board of Directors for a hearing, and (iv) a statement that the proposed sanction shall be imposed as contained in the notice unless a challenge is begun within ten (10) days of the notice. If a timely challenge is not made, the sanction stated in the notice shall be imposed.

If a hearing is requested within the allotted ten (10) day period, the Board shall send the owner notice of the date, time and place of the hearing by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the member at the address of record with the association at least fourteen (14) days prior to the hearing. The hearing shall be held in executive session affording the alleged violator a reasonable opportunity to be heard. Prior to the effectiveness of any sanction hereunder, proof of proper notice shall be placed in the minutes of the meeting. Such proof shall be deemed adequate if a copy of the notice, together with a statement of the date and manner of delivery, is entered by the officer, Director, or agent who delivered such notice. The notice requirement shall be deemed satisfied if the alleged violator appears at the meeting. The minutes of the meeting shall contain a written statement of the results of the hearing and the sanction, if any, imposed. The Board of Directors or the Covenants Committee may, but shall not be obligated to, suspend any proposed sanction if the violation is cured within the ten (10) day period. Such suspension shall not constitute a waiver of the right to sanction future violations of the same or other provisions and rules by any Person. 

(c) Appeal. Following a hearing before the Covenants Committee, the violator shall have the right to appeal the decision to the Board of Directors. To perfect this right, a written notice of appeal must be received by the manager, President, or Secretary of the Association within thirty (30) days after the hearing date. . 

(d) Additional Enforcement Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, the Association, acting through the Board of Directors, may elect to enforce any provision of the Declaration, these Bylaws, or the rules and regulations of the Association by self-help or by suit at law or in equity to enjoin any violation or to recover monetary damages or both without the necessity of compliance with the procedure set forth above. In any such action, to

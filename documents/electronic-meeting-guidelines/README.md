# Wyndham Forest Homeowners Association Electronic Meeting Guidelines

These electronic meeting guidelines were developed to satisfy Virgnia's Property Owners'
Association Act, section [55.1-1832](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title55.1/chapter18/section55.1-1832/)
(_Use of technology_), which was added with the adoption of
[House Bill 1816](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB1816)
(_Property Owners' Association Act/Condominium Act; use of electronic means for meetings
and voting_) in 2021.
 
  > F. Any meeting of the association, the board of directors, or any committee may be held entirely
  > or partially by electronic means, provided that the board of directors has adopted guidelines for
  > the use of electronic means for such meetings. Such guidelines shall ensure that persons accessing
  > such meetings are authorized to do so and that persons entitled to participate in such meetings
  > have an opportunity to do so. The board of directors shall determine whether any such meeting may
  > be held entirely or partially by electronic means.

These guidelines were created with inspiration from the following rules and guidelines of other organizations:

  1. [Robert’s Rules of Order Sample Rules for Electronic Meetings](https://robertsrules.com/sample-rules-for-electronic-meetings/)
  2. [National Pan-Hellenic Council Guidelines for Electronic Meetings](https://nphchq.com/millennium1/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/electronic_meeting_guidelines.pdf)
  3. [Ohio Association of Community Action Agencies Electronic Meeting Policy and Procedures](https://oacaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Electronic-Meeting-Policy.pdf)
  4. [Law Insider Electronic Meetings Sample Clauses](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/electronic-meetings)
  5. [Condominium Home Owners Association of BC Electronic Meeting Bylaws](https://www.choa.bc.ca/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE-Electronic-Bylaws.pdf)
  6. And many others found online

Many of these organizations’ documents contained details in their guidelines that we already include
in our governing documents. Therefore, those details were not duplicated here. These guidelines are
meant to extend our governing documents with details specific to electronic meetings.

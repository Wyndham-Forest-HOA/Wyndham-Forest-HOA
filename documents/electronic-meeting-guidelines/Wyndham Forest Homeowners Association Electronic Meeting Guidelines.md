   rights and responsibilities as if they were attending in person.

6. **Insufficient Meeting Resources**. If the electronic meeting provider has reliability issues
   or there are more attendees than the meeting is capable of hosting, the meeting shall be suspended
   or cancelled until the issues are resolved.
7. **Be Nice**. The meeting facilitator shall be permitted to temporarily mute a meeting attendee if
   their behavior would be considered inappropriate by a majority of homeowners. Any attendee that
   has been muted due to inappropriate behavior shall have the opportunity to meet with the meeting
   facilitator and board of directors privately for a discussion about the behavior.
8. **Recordings**. If an invitee requests the meeting to be recorded and the electronic meeting provider
   offers recordings at no additional cost, the meeting facilitator shall make a reasonable attempt to
   record the meeting and distribute the recording to all invitees within 3 days of the meeting.

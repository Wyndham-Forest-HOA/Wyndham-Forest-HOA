# Neighborhood WhatsApp Groups

In our neighborhood, there's a strong need for a quick group chat like tool for neighbors to
communicate. [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) fulfills that need, but has several limitations
that must be overcome for this to be a viable tool for our neighborhood. This document attempts to
list the limitations that we've recognized from the tool and proposes solutions to overcome the
limitations to allow the tool to be easily used by all of our neighbors.

# WhatsApp Limitations

WhatsApp has at least 2 limitations that make it a less than ideal tool for our neighborhood:

1. A WhatsApp group is limited to less than 256 participants. For more details, see the WhatsApp article on [_Adding and removing group participants_](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/web/26000157/?category=5245251).
2. WhatsApp does not have a feature for screening join requests before adding them to the group.

In the next sections, we will propose solutions to work around these limitations.

## Group Size Limit

A WhatsApp group is limited to less than 256 participants. For more details, see the WhatsApp article on [_Adding and removing group participants_](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/web/26000157/?category=5245251). Our neighborhood has 600+ homes, each with several permanent residents. If we use a single group, we will easily exceed the group size limit of 256 participants.

There's [a well-known workaround to this problem](https://www.google.com/search?q=whatsapp+group+size+limit+workaround) by using the group invite link to have participants join. However, with 600 homes we will go way past the 256 size limit and I don't know if the workaround will continue to work up to our needed size.

Instead of one large group, I propose that we use 5 groups, separated by subdivisions.

- Wyndham Forest (206 Homes)
- Chappell Ridge at Wyndham Forest (110 Homes)
- Rivers Edge at Wyndham Forest (34 Homes)
- Holloway at Wyndham Forest (217 Homes)
- Holloway Townes At Wyndham Forest (105 Homes)

Each group will be open to anyone that's a permanent resident of that subdivision. Additionally, the following people will be added to all groups:

- Current board members - To help address problems and quickly understand issues in the neighborhood.
- At least one member of the Social Media Committee - This person will be responsible for cross-posting messages that are relavent to other subdivisions in our neighborhood.

Holloway at Wyndham Forest is our largest subdivision and if every permanent resident joins the group, we will still exceed the 256 size limit. However, its unlikely that everyone in the subdivision will want to join WhatsApp. If we start to hit size limits and are unable to add neighbors, we'll revisit this issue.

## Screening Join Requests

In all of our neighborhood tools, we want to be able to limit participants to only permanent residents of our neighborhood to prevent nefarious people from causing harm to our community. On Facebook, we do this by asking questions about the user's address before they're allowed to join our group. On TownSq, our management company screens requests to join. WhatsApp does not have a similar feature. To join a group, the user needs to be added by a group admin or they need to use an invite link that group admins can share.

The easiest method for our neighbors to join their group would be to post the invite links in a public place, such as our HOA website. However, then anyone will be able to join and we will quickly run into problems with nefarious users joining and sending unwanted messages. Instead of posting the invite link, we will post the contact information for an admin in each of the groups. The admin will then screen the user before sharing the invite link with them.

With our proposed solution, we still have a risk that the invite link gets released into the public and non-residents join without first being screened. To mitigate this risk, group admins will need to monitor for the messages posted to a group when users join using the group invite link and contact users that join without first contacting them. If non-residents joining becomes too widespread, the invite link can be reset. We could also reset the link immediately after each user joins.

# Our Solution

We will have 5 WhatsApp groups for our neighborhood, seperated by subdivisions:

- Wyndham Forest
- Chappell Ridge at Wyndham Forest
- Rivers Edge at Wyndham Forest
- Holloway at Wyndham Forest
- Holloway Townes At Wyndham Forest

membership in the groups will be limited to

1. Permanent residents of the subdivision
2. Current board of directors
3. At least 1 member of the social media committee

Each group will have at least one resident designated as the group admin. The admin will have the following responsibilities:

1. Be unbiased when screening requests to join and cleaning up membership. All permanent residents of the subdivision are allowed to join.
2. Having their contact information posted on the HOA website and other places for residents to request to join.
3. Screening new join requests and maintaining records. Something as simple as a spreadsheet with phone number and address. Enough info to easily remove members after a house is sold.
4. Maintain the group membership. As houses are sold, remove members. If people join without introducing themselves, reach out to them and remove if they aren't residents.

The social media committee member will be responsible for monitoring the group chat and cross-posting to other groups information that's relavent to more than one subdivision.

At this time, we have no plans for a process to remove members that are consistently creating an unhealthy environment for other members. If this becomes an issue, we'll create a process and go through a feedback period before implementing. Hopefully this never happens.
